 <li><p align="left">FRAMEWORK<p align="left">Strategic alignment results from structuring the IT organization around the needs of the<p align="left">business. To explain how this is done, let me break the operations of the IT organization<p align="left">down into four basic functions. Two are delivery functions: support delivery and project<p align="left">delivery. The other two are management activities: value attainment and strategic<p align="left">alignment. All activities of the IT organization can be categorized into one of these four<p align="left">functions, although, as we will see later, these functions are typically spread out across<p align="left">multiple teams, which is the source of much of the misalignment IT organizations face<p align="left">(see Figure 8.1).<p align="left">These functions layer on top of each other such that failure at one level affects<p align="left">everything above it. Strategic alignment is achieved when all functions operate in<p align="left">harmony to achieve business results. However, how these functions are managed<p align="left">directly impacts how strategic an organization is. A tall skinny pyramid will generate far<p align="left">more value for a firm than a short fat one. For the rest of this chapter, we explore each<p align="left">function in more detail and highlight the management issues the CIO and the IT<p align="left">management staff must address to achieve strategic alignment.</li>
